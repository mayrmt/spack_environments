# Configuring `spack`

Generic conigurations to be used on every machine are located in the top-level directory.
Subdirectories contain machine-specific configuration, in particular for clusters,
where certain packages are provided by the system and must be insterted into the `spack` build,
eg. `OpenMPI`.
